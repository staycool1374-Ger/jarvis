# Role & Identity
## Branch: main — production kernel development. Do not use on testbed.
Autonomous expert systems engineer for Jarvis RTOS (hard real-time microkernel, freestanding C++20).

# Objective
Safely implement, validate, and evolve the architecture under strict functional safety (ISO 26262 ASIL D, IEC 61508) and compliance rules.

# Execution Lifecycle (Deterministic Loop)

### 1. Pre-Flight Health Check
- See AGENTS.md Pre-Flight rules.

### 2. Context Collection (Targeted Parsing)
- Parse `~/jarvis/ROADMAP.md` using targeted tool operations (e.g., grep for `-[ ]`) to locate ONLY the active milestone. Do not ingest completed sections ([x]) to preserve token economy.
- Check `~/jarvis/BUGS.md`. **Rule:** Critical bugs must be 100% resolved before feature work.
- Read `~/jarvis/project_structure.txt` to verify current workspace directory mappings and layout constraints.
- Read `~/jarvis/Makefile`.
- *Token Save:** Do not read full source files upfront; grep for specific functions/definitions as needed.

## Handling lessons.md (Conditional Rule)

Read and update the `lessons.md` file **only** when a debugging situation occurs:
1. An error, crash (Kernel Panic), or unexpected behavior is encountered.
2. A test fails (regression) or the compiler throws an error.
3. Explicitly asked for error analysis or "lessons learned".

**Behavior during Normal Operation (Planning / Implementing / Refactoring):**
- Completely ignore `lessons.md`. Do not read it and do not modify it during regular feature development to preserve token economy. Drop its contents out of the context window.

**Behavior during Debugging (After Successful Bug Fix):**
- As soon as a bug or crash is successfully resolved and the bug wasnt trivial then open `lessons.md` and append a short and compressed but informational entry:
  - What was the root cause of the error?
  - How was the error fixed?
  - How can this error be avoided?

### 3. Test-Driven Implementation
- Write/update Test Suite cases *before* altering kernel code.
- **Order for new features:** First add stub tests (`JARVIS_TEST_PASS()`) for every test idea, then replace stubs with real test assertions, then implement the feature to make them pass.
- **New tests are debug-only by default.** Use `JARVIS_REGISTER_TEST(name)` (debug target only). `make test-qemu` builds the debug target and runs ALL tests via `run_filtered(0)` (no TF_USER/TF_RELEASE filter). Only purely computational, zero-side-effect tests that have proven stable over many sessions may use `JARVIS_REGISTER_RELEASE_TEST(name)`. Release is a curated subset — `run_release()` calls `run_filtered(TF_RELEASE)` which runs only `JARVIS_REGISTER_RELEASE_TEST` tests (must invoke a shell in user task).
- **testbed branch:** All new tests are developed on the `testbed` branch, never on `main`. `testbed` contains test code only — no production kernel changes. After all tests pass (`make test-qemu`), merge `testbed` into `main`. Tests that depend on unimplemented APIs remain stubs and merge as-is (they document intent without regressions).
- **Test sanctity:** All non-stub tests are **read-only**. Only modify a non-stub test if it is systemically *wrong*. Changing a test requires: (1) reading its `Testidea`, `Input`, `Expect`, `Depends` doc-block and implementation; (2) reviewing the corresponding kernel function under test; (3) changing both doc-block and implementation together. The doc-block extension must be meaningful, precise, and short — explaining *why* the test was changed. Stubs (`JARVIS_TEST_PASS()` only) may be freely replaced with real implementations.

### Pseudocode in Stub Tests
* Some stub tests contain `/* Pseudocode: ... */` comments describing intended behavior — use these for insight when implementing.
* When writing new stub tests, a pseudocode block is required inside the test function to document the intended test flow.

### 4. Verification & QEMU Validation
- Run automated test suites via `make test-qemu`.
- See AGENTS.md for Circuit Breaker limits.

### 5. Bug Tracking & Documentation Updates
- Log new failures in `BUGS.md` using schema: ID, Description, Severity, Domain, Status.
- Update `LESSONS.md` with compressed hardware/architectural insights if not trivial.
- Sync docs (`README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `BUGS.md`).
- Regenerate file manifest: `tree -I "build|obj|.git|node_modules" > ~/jarvis/project_structure.txt`.

### ResourceTracker (Strict Awareness)
- See AGENTS.md ResourceTracker section for leak-detection rules.
- **Adding new resources:** If you introduce a new kernel resource type, add counters + track_* calls in ResourceTracker AND update `test_isolate.cpp` buffer layout. No exceptions.

### 6. Release Workflow (-dev → release)

**Pre-flight gate (abort on any failure):**
- Verify `git status --porcelain` is clean
- Run `make test-qemu` — this launches the kernel in QEMU and runs ALL registered tests via `run_registered(0)` (debug build, `all` test class). All must pass (`[FAIL]` count = 0). Do **not** rely on a partial test run; confirm the serial output shows the full test count (600+ tests, not ~96).
- Check `testcases-v$(KERNEL_VERSION).md` — if still `*Outline*` or any stubs remain, **abort**. If all tests implemented, delete the file.
- Verify tag `v$(major).$(minor).$(patch)` does not exist: `git tag | grep "v$(major).$(minor).$(patch)"`

**Release sequence:**
- Read `src/lib/version.hpp`; capture `major.minor.patch`
- Update `Doxyfile` PROJECT_NUMBER to release version
- Run `doxygen Doxyfile`
- Update version strings in `README.md` and `readme.html`
- Move completed roadmap items from `ROADMAP.md` → `ROADMAP_done.md`; update `EXECUTIVE OVERRIDE` to next target
- Strip `-dev` from `KERNEL_VERSION_STRING` and set `stage = ""` in `version.hpp`
- Regenerate manifest: `tree -I "build|obj|.git|node_modules" > ../project_structure.txt`
- Commit all changes: `git add -A && git commit -m "release: v$(major).$(minor).$(patch)"`
- Push: `git push origin main`
- Tag: `git tag v$(major).$(minor).$(patch) && git push origin v$(major).$(minor).$(patch)`
- Mirror to Nextcloud: `mkdir -p ~/Nextcloud/arnold/jarvis/ && rsync -a --delete --exclude=build --exclude=.git ~/jarvis/ ~/Nextcloud/arnold/jarvis/`

**Post-release (new dev cycle):**
- Increment patch (or major/minor per ROADMAP.md next milestone)
- Re-add `-dev` to `KERNEL_VERSION_STRING` and set `stage = "dev"`
- Commit: `git add -A && git commit -m "bump: v$(next)-dev"`
- Push: `git push origin main`

# New Test Infrastructure (v0.2.19+)

## Test Classes (Config-Driven)
Test execution is driven by `initrd/tests/test-config.txt` (one class per line). The kernel parses this at boot and registers only those classes. Default fallback: `safe` class (~96 tests, <5s target).

**Available classes (defined in `src/kernel/test/test_registry.cpp`):**
- `safe` — curated TF_RELEASE subset (lib, checked_ptr, block_device, fat32, vfs_fat32, waitpid, shell_interaction)
- `all` — everything including benchmarks (~600+ tests)
- Individual: `scheduler`, `memory`, `ipc`, `vfs`, `process`, `syscall`, `arch`, `device`, `shell`, `net`, `security`, `debug`, `integration`, `stress`, `init`, `build`, `bench`, `sporadic`

## Makefile Targets
| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `make test-selftest` | Debug build, runs `safe` class, auto-shutdown (CI gate) |
| `make test-all-debug` | Debug build, runs `all` class, auto-shutdown |
| `make test-all-release` | Release build, runs `all` class with TF_RELEASE filter, auto-shutdown |
| `make test-class CLASS=<name>` | Debug build, specific class |
| `make test-gdb TEST=suite::name` | GDB single-test |
| `make test-shell` | Interactive shell boot |

**Legacy aliases:** `test-qemu` → `test-all-debug`, `release-test` → `test-all-release`

## Host-Side Watchdog
All test targets run under `_run_test_qemu` in the Makefile, which launches a background monitor thread. If `/tmp/jarvis-serial.log` does not grow for `WATCHDOG_STALL` consecutive seconds (default 10), the monitor kills QEMU and appends a diagnostic. This catches hangs the in-kernel watchdog cannot detect (e.g., while interrupts are disabled during test execution).

The serial log is captured via `tee` to `/tmp/jarvis-serial.log` for all automated runs. The first `tee` pipe exit code (`PIPESTATUS[0]`) is used for result propagation.

## CI Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
| Step | Target | Timeout |
|------|--------|---------|
| Build | `make debug` | — |
| Selftest gate | `make test-selftest` (safe class) | `timeout 360` — Makefile expect timeout 120s |
| Full suite | `make test-all-debug` (all classes) | `timeout 360` — Makefile expect timeout 180s |

The full suite step runs only if selftest passes (`if: success()`). Both steps use the host-side watchdog and expect-based result parsing (extracts PLANNED/EXECUTED/FAILED from the TEST SUMMARY block).

## Output Format
Per-test line (no ANSI colors):
```
S: <testclass> <suite::name> <n/m>: PASS/FAIL [LEAK: Resource +N, ...]
```

Summary block (after all tests):
```
==============================
 TEST SUMMARY
  PLANNED: 96
  EXECUTED: 96
  TIME_ELAPSED_MS: 4231
  PASSED: 94
  FAILED: 2
==============================
```

**Leak details** appear only on FAIL lines. Resources tracked: MemPool0, PMM, Tasks, BufPool, MsgQueues, Notifies, EventGroups, Drivers, PipeBufs, VNodes, OpenFDs.

## Test Flags (test.hpp)
- `TF_KERNEL` = 0 (default, debug-only)
- `TF_RELEASE` = 1<<0 (runs in release mode)
- `TF_USER` = 1<<1 (user-space tests, skipped in kernel self-test)
- `TF_BENCH` = 1<<2 (benchmark tests, excluded from normal runs)

## Serial FIFO Drain
Both `run_filtered()` and `run_registered()` drain the UART TX FIFO (wait for LSR bits 5&6) before QEMU exit to prevent report truncation.

## GDB Single-Test
`make test-gdb TEST=suite::name` launches QEMU with GDB stub, sets breakpoint on `test_suite_name`, runs to it. Use for debugging individual flaky tests.

## Known Test Patterns

### Blocking Syscall Handling
`MinimalPrivilegedSurface` (test_microkernel_transition.cpp) enumerates all syscalls 0–48 with null args. Some syscalls block or terminate the calling task: `RECEIVE`, `SEND_SYNC`, `EXIT`, `NOTIFY_WAIT`, `EVENT_WAIT`, `PAUSE`. These are skipped via `is_blocking()` lambda — the test verifies dispatch for non-blocking syscalls only.

### SpinLock Guard Patterns
`Semaphore::add_waiter()`/`wake_one()` and `Queue::add_send_waiter()`/`add_recv_waiter()`/`wake_send_one()`/`wake_recv_one()` must NOT take their own `lock_` — the caller already holds it. Redundant SpinLockGuard causes immediate deadlock on non-recursive `__atomic_exchange_n` spinlocks.

# Coding Standards
All mandatory coding rules, safety constraints, and error-handling patterns are defined in `CODING_STYLE.md`. Refer to that document for:
- Language & build conventions (C++20 freestanding, no STL/RTTI/exceptions)
- Naming, formatting, and documentation style
- Memory & ownership (no dynamic allocation on real-time paths)
- Error handling (ENSURE, ASSERT, module error headers, ErrorOr)
- Safety & compliance (ISO 26262, MISRA C++:2023, AUTOSAR)
- Testing conventions (test-first, doc-blocks, debug vs release registration)
- Kernel-specific mandatory rules (const correctness, references over pointers, var initialization, ctor init-lists, sentinel enums, descriptive names, no const_cast)

# Debugging Notes
- See AGENTS.md Debugging Notes section for historical issues and troubleshooting tips.

# Diagnostic Verification
If a test fails or a regression is detected:
- Immediately inspect the `debug_switch_ring` state using the GDB panic surveillance targets (`make test-gdb`) to extract `entry_addr`, `exit_rip`, and `consumed_ticks` of the faulting task sequence.
- Check for page-table leaks or memory corruption if the failure involves `clone()` or parent-child PML4 space isolation.
