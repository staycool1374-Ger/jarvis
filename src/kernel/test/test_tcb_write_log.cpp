// Intent: prove the ring-buffer write tracker "catches" a stray write by
// dumping the last legitimate modifiers of a corrupted TCB.
//
// A real stray write bypasses the TCB_WRITE macro, so it is NOT recorded
// itself — that is precisely why the post-detection dump is valuable: it
// shows the last *legitimate* writers (callers) of the corrupted TCB,
// narrowing the suspect code path.
//
// Run with CONFIG_TCB_WRITE_LOG and grep the serial log for
// "[TCB-WRITE-LOG]" to confirm the dump was emitted.
